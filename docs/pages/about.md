## About

<p>The Data Preparedness community emerged from the Exploratory Meeting on Data Preparedness held on March 21-22, 2023, organized by the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence. Participants were representatives from government agencies, academia, and philanthropic organizations who formed this global collaborative group to enhance country-to-country interaction and coordination in data preparedness. </p>
An action committee, proposed by the community, will drive the initiatives. This repository serves as the starting platform for community members to contribute, exchange ideas, and propose potential solutions.

## Background

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for preparedness also for future threats. To achieve this, sophisticated data analytics, technological infrastructure, and capacity building are crucial. Public health agencies and ministries of health are in need for data readiness before emergencies occur. Data preparedness ensures readily available data for visualization and analysis, enabling rapid insights for better decision-making. Making data available for public health decisions is a valuable investment. However, creating compatible systems across countries and promoting effective interactions poses challenges. Governments may prioritize national interests and lack resources for external collaboration. To address this, open communication and cooperation among all stakeholders are essential for implementing effective solutions promptly. The Data Preparedness Community aims to support this.
